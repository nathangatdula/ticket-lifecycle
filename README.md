<p>
Observing the ticket screen below, you can see that you can change the Status, Priority, Department, etc.
<p>
Depending on the severity of the situation, the agent working this ticket, in this case Jane Doe as someone overlooking this department, can change the priority to what it should be and also assign it to who it is most appropriate to. In this ticket, it seems like the entire mobile online banking is down for this company. It is sent to the System Administrators Department and assigned to Jane Doe. She works on this ticket and communicates with Karen who sent in this ticket and resolves it.
<p>
Notice the ticket thread shows updates and reply history between the end user and the agent.

In this case, this ticket is assigned to Jon Doe in the Support department with a High priority from Jane Doe.

<p>
Jon got to work and figured out why the entire accounting department's adobe reader was not working. He provided a temporary solution in order to work on the fix.

<p>
This final ticket was a low priority Sev-C sent to the Support department and assigned to Jane Doe. Since Jane Doe knew the information Karen wanted to know, she simply replied to her with the info and resolved the ticket.

All the tickets have been resolved with the appropriate assignment to priority, department, etc.!
